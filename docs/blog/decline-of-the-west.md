# The Decline of the West

The author, Oswald Spengler, mentioned in the introduction of Volume I, Form and Actuality, that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had a saying. That saying was "What is important in life is life and not a result of life,". What I can gather from this saying is how potentially lost man is in the early 21st century. To be conscious in the present moment is a gift itself, we should strive to be in this state in order to grow a deeper sense into our lives. Working with a purpose is far different than working without one for the sake of survival. The act of surviving can sometimes cloud the thought of being. To simplify, rather than chasing materialistic items, vanity, consciousless activities, and mind-altering substances, life itself is already here and that chase should be "fulfilled" to a certain extent. Yes, having ambitions and missions _can_ help deliver a sense of higher purpose in our daily routines, but what about the broader view? What has history said about the progress of mankind? (Mankind is in essense, not an appropriate term, per Vol. I). Ever since man has experienced or at least been conditioned to experience life as a linear journey, I believe this may have strayed us away from a more fulfilling one. The majority of people seek results within their life to fulfill that void. Rather than realizing life in itself is what we already have, and we should be grateful for it.
