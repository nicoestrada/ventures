# Finding a fit

Earlier I have read a book titled, Blitzscaling, by Reid Hoffman whom is the co-founder of LinkedIn. It was one of those reads that I could not put down. After reading it cover to cover in a few days I bought a hard-copy in order to have one to make my own annotations refer back to it as time goes on. Anyway, what really stood out to me was this story about how 3 brothers sold a start-up for 8-figures after building and launching in a span of *40 days*. It was reported that these 3 brothers were inspired by what eBay had built at the turn of the century except they wanted to do something similar for the European market. As I pondered about how this could work, it started to make more sense as I continued to read on. They weren't concerned with eBay "already being created" so they were too late. If anything, eBay only realized and confirmed an online marketplace for a large audience in the United States and these 3 brothers decided to build something similar for Europe. So, as the dot-com boom continued to be the rage, they created this German auction site, called Alando. In a matter of a few months, eBay was well aware of this and rather than running the risk of losing marketshare of an emerging economy, eBay offered to buy Alando outright for $43 million. The 3 brothers,or the Samwer brothers, then sold their German auction site to the main competitor before it even had a chance to cement their foot in the market. Rather than spending a lot of time on "fit", the Samwer brothers took initiative and replicated something that was proven, and got paid for it.
