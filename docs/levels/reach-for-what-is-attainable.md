# Reach for what is attainable

As I mature and grow as a person, life never fails to reveal new lessons to me as I encounter new experiences. An interesting lesson that I have recently came to realize is my own self-growth as a person and how I was able to get to the position that I am in today. I sit back and think in order to ponder my journey to up to this point so I may be able to assess what exactly led to this moment in my life often. Writing is hard. Thinking is hard. In an era of constant attention merchants battling for our most valuable asset that we can control, we must do our best be wise to where we decide to use our attention. A couple years ago, I decided enough was enough. I wanted to start being better. I was guided to start reading. And this was how it all began. There are several openings to begin the reading journey, I chose the ones that could at least be of use to my immediate problems at hand and went from there. I quickly learned that reading was also best utilized if you apply the knowledge in your own life, otherwise you risk becoming stuck in a trance of analysis paralysis. By me being here today, it is all the evidence that I need to explain what is possible for one self when you reach for something that is attainable. However one might choose to interpret that, is obviously up to them. My personal interpretation is this, if you truly desire change, be the change you seek and be consistent. Half of the battle is just showing up. Set a definite goal or mission and follow through with actionable steps to achieve it. Time usually indicates this process has the greatest ROI of any other sort of activity for growth. I can speak from personal experience that this is the way.
